Bottom-up introduction to `build2`
==================================

## Presentation
### Who am I
  JoÃ«l Lamotte aka "Klaim", I use CMake at work and home,
  I also use `build2` to experiment for future projects,
  and at work in some prototypes.
  My job is currently in robotics but I have a background in other domains
  mostly videogames and embedded software.

### Why this talk?
  Someone asked a few months ago to CPPFrugs
  that I present `build2` as an alternative to `CMake`.
  A lot of people are frustrated with `CMake` and are looking
  for new tools but lack the time for a proper introduction.
  As I am interested in `build2` (but not an expert) and experiment a lot
  with it for future projects, I was asked to give an intro of how it works.

  I will explain how `build2` works with the goal that you can start using
  it immediately after the talk after having installed it.
  You still need to read the official documentation, but this should be a good
  starting point to at least play with it.

### Clarifications
  - `build2` have nothing to do with `boost.build`'s `b2` provided and used by Boost.
  - I will not directly compare `build2` to CMake, that would be too long
  - We'll use `build2` `v0.12.0`
  - This will be interactive, raise your hand if you have questions.

### Questions

1. Who is familiar with CMake?
2. Who is familiar with Make?
3. Who is not familiar with how C++ code is built? (transformed into executable binaries)
4. Who is familiar with C++20 Modules?
5. Who wants to make a talk about Meson?
6. Who wants to make a talk about vcpkg?
7. Who is only here to eat for free?

## Build-System
### Demo 1 : just build some code

1. open `hello.cpp`

2. create a `buildfile` and open it.
  - `buildfile` is equivalent to a `makefile`
  - It describes the targets to build if we invoke the build system for this directory

3. Use `C++`:
    ```
    using cxx
    ```
   - In `build2`, C++ is just a build-system module.
   - That's what is used to build `build2` itself.
   - There are other buils-system modules to add features and languages (`c`, `testing` etc.)
   - You use what you need.
   - There is an experiment for a `rust` build-system module.


4. Add a target:
    ```
    exe{hello} : cxx{hello}
    ```
   - `build2` follows a inherit the target system from make:
   ```
   target-name : requirement-1 requirement-2
   ```
   - However it adds **typing** to the targets, instead of **recipes**
   ```
   typeA{target-name} : typeB{requirement-1} typeC{requirement-2}
   ```
   - `cxx` targets are C++ compilation unit, `hxx` are C++ headers etc.

5. Change the default extension to `cpp` and `hpp`:
    ```
    cxx{*}: extension = cpp
    hxx{*}: extension = hpp
    ```
   - By default the extension searched is `cxx`, `hxx`, etc. but we can change it to whatever.
   - Targets and target types have variables to specify their properties.

6. Build & run:
    ```
    b
    ./hello Man
    ```
    - `b` is the build system
    - `b` invoked alone means `b update` which means **"update this directory's buildfile output"**
    - The compiler used by default depends on which compiler was used to build/install `build2`
    - We can specify the compiler and other variables for a specific invocation:
    ```
    b config.cxx=clang++-9
    ```
    - On Windows, the default `msvc` compiler is the highest version, including previews.
    - We can pecify a compiler path (the rest is guessed from the compiler name):
    ```
    b "config.cxx='...\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.23.28105\bin\Hostx64\x86\cl'"
    ```
    - We can specify `C++` version that way too, otherwise it's `latest`:
    ```
    b config.cxx.std=14     # -std=c++14 (if the compiler allows it)
    b config.cxx.std=latest # last released C++
    ```



7. Cleanup:
    ```
    b clean
    ```
    - We can chain commands: `b clean update`
    - Commands are provided and implemented by build-system modules.
    - To see all the available commands of a project: `b info`

### Demo 2 : just build all the files

1. Separate the printing into files: `print.hpp` `print.cpp`

2. To build these files too:
    ```
    exe{hello} : cxx{hello print} hxx{print}
    ```
    - Requirements of the same types can be grouped in the same expression.
    ```
    exe{hello} : {hxx cxx}{hello print}
    ```
    - Search files of the right type/extension with these names.

3. Glob all the cpp and hpp files:
    ```
    exe{hello} : cxx{*} hxx{*}
    ```
    - We just get all the files of the extension/type specified as requirements.
    ```
    exe{hello} : cxx{**} hxx{**}
    ```
    - Recursively glob.
    ```
    exe{hello} : {cxx hxx}{**}
    ```
    - Shorter.

### Demo 3 : just a library

1. Move "print" files into a library.

2. Create `print` library target:
    ```
    exe{hello} : {cxx}{hello} lib{print}

    lib{print}: {cxx hxx}{print}
    ```
    - order of target declaration is not important
    - by default the first target (and it's requirement) is built
    - requiring the directory to build targtets by default:
    ```
    ./ : exe{hello} lib{print}
    ```
    - or by chaining requirements:
    ```
    ./ : exe{hello} : {cxx}{hello} lib{print}
    ./ : lib{print} : {cxx hxx}{print}
    ```

3. Force usage of the static version of the `print` library (`liba` target type):
    ```
    exe{hello} : {cxx}{hello} liba{print}
    ```
    - Libraries can be static-only, dynamic/shared-only or both (the default).
    - User can specify which version they want.
    - By default, use the dynamic/shared version.
    - Use the usual symbol export/import macros in libraries that need to be shared/dynamic.

### Demo 4 : just a bunch of libraries

1. Grouped target sources in directories.
    ```
    exe{hello} : hello/{hxx cxx}{*} liba{print}
    lib{print} : print/{cxx hxx}{*}
    ```
    - `lib{print}` headers are not found by `exe{hello}` (yet).

2. Make add the root directories to include directories:
    ```
    cxx.poptions =+ "-I$src_root"
    ```
    - Also need to use the directory in the include: `#include <print/print.hpp>`
    - `poptions` means "preprocessor options"
    - There are other options: `coptions` (compiler), `loptions` (link), etc.
    - We use the gcc/clang syntax which will be translated for msvc (if possible).
    - This is ok for simple cases but we didn't make consumers of our library inherit
      information to consume the library.

3. Specify properties that library consumers should have:
    ```
    lib{print} : cxx.export.poptions =+ "-I$src_root"
    ```
    - As before, targets have specific properties.
    - All the `*.export.*` properties are for the consuming side.

### Demo 5 : did you say "modules" ?

1. We want to experiment with incoming C++ features:
    ```
    cxx.std = experimental # or = 20 if C++20 is officially available in your compiler
    ```
    - `cxx.std = latest` is better most of the time.

2. Modules "primary module interface" needs to have a different target-type/extension
    ```
    mxx{*}: extension = mpp
    ```
    - By default it's `mxx`, you don't need this line if you follow the default names.

3. No need for headers anymore, grab the module interfaces:
    ```
    lib{print} : print/{cxx mxx}{*}
    ```

4.










---------------------------------------------


simple, 1 buildfile, few cpp files
 1. C/C++ is a buildsystem module
 2. show that the target system and syntax are similar to make
 3. build and run a small executable
 4. add files without changing the buildfile and build+run them
 5. add a simple (static) library used by the initial executable
 6. add a module library
 7. add `__symexport` to allow libraries to be dynamic


  1. `build2` toolset
    1. build system + package manager + testing + ...
    2.  `b` is the buildsystem: make, msbuild, ninja, etc...
        It's NOT a meta-buildsystem like CMake, Meson...
        `b2` is NOT `b` and is part of `boost.build`, another build system used by Boost.
    3.  `bpkg` is the package manager: conan, vcpkg, etc.
    4.  `bdep` is
